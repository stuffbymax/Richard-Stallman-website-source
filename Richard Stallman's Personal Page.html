      Richard Stallman has cancer.  Fortunately it is slow-growing and
      manageable follicular lymphoma.  Treatment put it into
      remission, and he can expect to live many more years.  However,
      he now has to be even more careful not to catch Covid-19.

  Robert Reich explains how the bullshitter and Republicans
  are <a href="https://invidio.us/watch?v=3Cjjh3VNOjs">trying to spread
  chaos</a> to discourage non-fascists from voting.  After creating as
  much real chaos as they can, they pretend there is even more of it,
  hoping Americans will give up and not vote, or support a fascist
  strong man.
<p>
  I urge you to vote in Democratic primaries for the progressive
  candidate, if there is one.  And in the final election I urge you to
  vote for Democrats, unless a liberal independent had a good chance
  of winning.

Canadians: I suggest you seek election advice at a local chapter of a
group that pushes to curb global heating and has the courage to say,
"Canada should stop exporting fossil fuel."  It will at least use the
right goals to suggest who to vote for in your area.

<!-- These are the "Urgent action items" on the front page. 


1)  Important: please enable telephone power for urgent actions.
    So from now on, please add an HTML paragraph at the end of urgent notes

    * that calls on Congress, the Senate, or any of their members:

    <p>
    If you phone, please spread the word!                              
    Main Switchboard: <a href="tel:+12022243121">+1-202-224-3121</a>
    </p>

    * or that calls on the White House or the President:

    <p>
    If you phone, please spread the word!
    White House: <a href="tel:+12024561111">+1-202-456-1111</a>
    and (TTY/TDD) +1-202-456-6213</p>

    * or that calls on state governors

    <p>
    Please find your state governor phone number at
    <a href="https://www.usa.gov/state-governments">USA.gov</a>

    
    (I.e. not to limit actions to URLs)

2)  Likewise, please remember to consider adding this to any pol note about
    the Israeli-Palestinian conflict:

    <p>
    Let's not lose sight of
    <a href="https://stallman.org/articles/benevolence.html">where we want to end up</a>.

    It says:
    Let Benevolence Shine
    Richard Stallman, 2023-12-14

        Twixt the river and the sea,
        Palestine nigh Israel be.
        Both in peace, let both be free;
        Be lands of democracy.

    We should not get so caught up in how to take the difficult next step that we
    forget where we are trying to get to.

    The above info is also found in two other files for your convenience:
      ~helpers/topnums 
      /archives/topnums.
    which are linked together as aliases by the ln command.

3)  Please note: this file has a symbolic link, an alias:
        /public_html/common/urgent_action.html
        /home/helpers/urgent.html 
    The two are nearly the same; 
    removing urgent.html will not remove urgent_action.html

    The command to alias them is done from /home/helpers:
    ln -s /home/rms/public_html/common/urgent_action.html urgent.html

for political influence</a>.
</p><p>
Here's how to make the actionnetwork.org letter campaign linked above function without running the
site's nonfree JavaScript code.
</p><p>
First, make sure you have deactivated JavaScript or are using the LibreJS plug-in.
</p><p>
I have done the next step for you: I added `?nowrapper=true' to the end of the campaign URL before
posting it above.  That should bring you to a page that starts with, "Letter campaigns will not work
without JavaScript!"
</p><p>
They indeed won't work without some manual help, but the following simple method seems adequate for
some of them.
</p><p>
To start, fill in the personal information answers in the box on the right side of the page.  That's
how you say who's sending the letter.
</p><p>
Then click the "START WRITING" button.  That will take you to a page that can't function without
nonfree JavaScript code.  (To ensure it doesn't function perversely <em>by running</em> that nonfree
code, you can enable LibreJS or disable JavaScript.)  You can finish sending without that code By
editing its URL in the browser's address bar, as follows:
</p><p>
First, go to the end and insert `&amp;nowrapper=true'.  Then tell the browser to visit that URL.  This
should give you a version of the page that works without JavaScript.  Enter the subject and body of
your letter.  Finally, click on the "SEND LETTER" button, and you're done.
</p><p>
This method seems to work for letter campaigns that send the letters to a fixed list of recipients,
the same recipients for every sender.  Editing and revisiting the URL is the only additional step
needed to bypass the nonfree JavaScript code.  I'm sure you'll agree it is a small effort compared
with the benefit of supporting the campaign without opening your computer to unjust (and potentially
malicious) software.

Insructions in a nutshell:

Only 4 list items are wanted here.  If you add a new list item to the top of
this file, then please *move* the oldest list item at the bottom over to:

    ~/public_html/there-ought-to-be-a-law.html 

Thanks.

Here is the detailed version.

The list items in this file are presented on the main page of stallman.org,
/index.html.  So it shouldn't take up too much page space.  Four texts is the
current desired limit. 

New texts should be added to this file at the top of the list 
as new list items with an id attribute of your choosing.

Old list items should then be subtracted from the bottom of this list, and moved
from here to the top of the list in /there-ought-to-be-a-law.html.  

No info is lost. The stallman.org URL 

    /there-ought-to-be-a-law.html

links to the whole version, the master list of laws that ought to be.  It
renders the entire list because it is set up to transclude the list items in
this file:

    /common/ought-to-be-a-law.html
    
putting the items in this file at the top.

The front page offers the link text "More items where there ought to be a law".
This takes you to the whole version. When viewed in your text editor, then:

    /common/ought-to-be-a-law  (this primary receiving file, the head file)

    <p>
      Whether the owners are Chinese is a question that there is no need to
      ask, because the state should <em>never</em> give money to a business "to
      support it."
      Instead it should offer to lend money to the company for suitable
      repayment, or else buy equity at a fair price.
    </p><p>
      These two ways of supporting a company avoid giving the owners an

      It is exciting that SB 976 turns towards restricting recommendation algorithms.  But
      these options should not be limited to minors — every user
      <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2023-jul-oct.html#8_September_2023_(Taking_control_away_from_social_media_sites)">should
	have this choice</a>.  (Please do not refer to teenagers as
      "children"; that feeds the US tendency to treat them like children and
      <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2023-may-aug.html#20_July_2023_(Free-play_kid_programs)">retard
	their development</a>.)
    </p><p>
      However, I suggest taking a step beyond just choosing to use or not use the
      <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2023-nov-feb.html#7_February_2024_(Misogynistic_messages)">platform's
      addiction system</a>.  Recommendation algorithms should be completely separated from platforms!
    </p><p>
      If you want to use a nontrivial recommendation algorithm, you should
      be able to choose it yourself and use it anonymously.  You could send
      it the URLs you want it to base its choices on.  These might be some
      of the pages you had visited, and perhaps pages you had not visited.
    </p><p>
      Then it should send <i>you</i> its recommendations.  You could pass
      all, or just some, or none of those recommendations to the platform to
      look at them.
    </p><p>
      AB 1949 is admirable because it gives a small boost to privacy for
      users of all ages, not only for children.  It isn't enough, though
      — users should also be guaranteed the right and possibility to
      access through the Tor network and to use aliases.  And collection of
      a user's data by the state should require a warrant against the user.

If a private landlord says, "I can't afford to do the repairs that the
law now requires," there is an easy response: "So sell that house."
Most of them will then discover some money that they had temporarily
forgotten possessing.  As for the rest, it's no disaster if they do
have to sell.
</p><p>
For housing owned by local governments, it is another matter.  They
are cutting all sorts of important public services because the Tories
cut their budgets to the bone, and Labour refuses to raise them.  Some
are already going bankrupt.  If Labour really wants those buildings
repaired, it will have to provide money.

</p><p>
I am sure this is true, but the FTC has missed much of the problem by
defining "surveillance" too narrowly.  They presume that collecting
data about people only becomes "surveillance" when the platform makes
the data available somehow to unrelated companies.
</p><p>
<a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html.">See </a>
</p><p>
The FTC also made the typical pernicious assumption that unjust
treatment of adult users is not important.
</p><p>
I am not sure whether the report included allowing other companies
to target categories of users in the category of "surveillance".
In that practice, the other companies do not actually <em>receive</em>
data about individual users, but do get to exploit them.

Some US states will report parents to the Parent Gestapo ("Child
Welfare Services") for "neglect" if they don't pay the bill for 
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/19/unpaid-school-lunch-debt-child-welfare-services">their
child's school lunch.</a>
</p><p>
That isn't neglect of the children, it is neglect of the state.
But I think it is the state's fault anyway, not the parent's
that that parent is too poor to pay for the 
<a href="https://civicshout.com/p/pass-tim-walz-s-free-lunch-for-kids-program-in-every-state?ref=yFtDwTM&amp;link_id=1&amp;can_id=8b24519448cbedadde1c8a966f94caad&amp;source=email-sign-if-you-agree-pass-tim-walzs-free-lunch-for-kids-program-in-every-state">child's lunch.
It ought to do that.</a>
</p><p>
In reality, what is the usual cause of parents' neglecting children?
I expect it is poverty — what a child needs costs a lot of money and
many parents can't get that much money.  Growing up in poverty may
result in real neglect, but punishing the parent(s) won't help
them get more money.
</p><p>
Taking the child away from the parent(s) and giving per to a foster
parent might help per, by making more money available; but if the
state is willing to provide that extra money, it can just as well give
that to the child's parent(s).
</p><p>
Thus, the only case in which to consider taking a child away from per
parent(s) is when the cause is something other than poverty.

Two New York City transit <a class="glossary" href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a> cornered an alleged fare evader who
allegedly pulled a knife.  At that point, they proceeded to make the
subway substantially more dangerous by hitting two other innocent
passengers and one other <a class="glossary" href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#thug">thug</a>, as well as the 
<a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/09/16/brooklyn-subway-fare-shooting-police-violence/">alleged fare evader.</a>
</p><p>
It is quite possible that the many really did try to evade the fare.
That is no grounds for shooting him.  It is possible that he pulled out
a knife, which would be a much more serious crime.  However, I won't
take <a class="glossary" href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a>' word that he did so.  They might be "<a class="glossary" href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#testilying">testilying</a>", to use
the term that <a class="glossary" href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a> coined for this.
</p><p>
Adams, NYC's night-mayor, is a former <a class="glossary" href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#thug">thug</a> himself, and no matter what
harm <a class="glossary" href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a> do in the city, he always claims it's not their fault.

<h3>No national identity cards</h3>
<p>
I'd like to make a list of countries that do not require a national
identity card, and have no plans to adopt one. If you live in or have
confirmed knowledge of such a country, please send email to rms at
gnu.org.

</p><p>
Here's my list of countries with no national ID cards
and no plans for one: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK.
Australia's previous government tried to
institute national ID cards, but the Labor government dropped
the plan.</p>

<p>India has mostly finished imposing a national biometric ID number
in a grand act of oppression.
</p>

<p>Switzerland has national ID cards which are optional,
but they or some other government ID card are needed for some purposes.
</p><p>
Iceland doesn't have ID cards as such, but they
have ID numbers that citizens are forced to use frequently.
For example, the national ID number is often required to
rent a video or use a gym.
</p>

<p>
Denmark issues non-photo ID cards with a "person number", and many
services use this card to identify people.
</p>

<p>
Norway will impose a national
<a href="http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Norwegian_citizens_now_required_by_law_to_give_their_fingerprint_to_the_police.html">biometric
ID card</a>.
</p>

<h3>The Lifelong Activist</h3>
<p>
People often ask how I manage to continue devoting myself to
progressive activism (such as the free software movement) for
years without burning out.  The best way I can answer is by
recommending a book, <a href="https://hillaryrettigproductivity.com/the-lifelong-activist/">
The Lifelong Activist</a> by Hillary Rettig.

</p><p>I disagree with the book on one theoretical point in the last
part of the book: we shouldn't think of political activism as
<em>being</em> marketing and sales, because those terms refer to
business, and politics is something much more
important than mere business.  However, this doesn't diminish
the value of the book's practical advice about borrowing
techniques from marketing and sales.</p>
